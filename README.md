### Setup

This website is built from the [Start Bootstrap Freelancer theme](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-freelancer), on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). If you'd like to build it on your local machine, do the following:

 - [Install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
 - in the base directory of this repo, do `jekyll serve --future`
