Welcome! This repo contains the website for the 2017 Research Bazaar festival. If you'd like to learn more about how to bring ResBaz to your town, have a look at [this blog](https://resbazblog.wordpress.com/) - we'd be delighted to work with you!

## Local Sites

In addition to the main page, this website also offers local listings for each site joining us for ResBaz 2017. If you want your site added, open an issue to start the process, and we'll get you set up right away.

### Setup

This website is built from the [Start Bootstrap Freelancer theme](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-freelancer), on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). If you'd like to build it on your local machine, do the following:

 - [Install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
   - If your operating system is OS X El Capitan, modify the instructions at that link by changing `gem install jekyll` to `gem install -n /usr/local/bin jekyll`. The reason for this is explained [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32891965/error-while-executing-gem-errnoeperm-operation-not-permitted).
 - In the base directory of this repo, do `jekyll serve --future`
 - If all has gone well, you'll be able to visit your version of the main website at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` and the various city pages at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/melbourne`, `http://127.0.0.1:4000/auckland`, etc.
